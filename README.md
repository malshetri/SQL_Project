# Background
Driven by a goal to better understand and navigate the data analyst job market, this project was created to identify the top-paying and most in-demand skills—making it easier for others to find the most rewarding career opportunities.

The data comes from the course I have taken [SQL course](http://lukebarousse.com/sql) and includes valuable insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL**: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL**: The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code**: My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub**: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here’s how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

``` sql
SELECT
    j.job_id,
    j.job_title,
    j.job_location,
    j.job_schedule_type,
    j.salary_year_avg,
    j.job_posted_date,
    c.name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact AS j
    LEFT JOIN company_dim AS c ON j.company_id = c.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:
- Top salary: Mantys offered the highest-paying data analyst role in 2023 at $650K, well above the market average.
